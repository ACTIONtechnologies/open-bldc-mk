Description:
============

This is a side project of Open-BLDC (http://open-bldc.esden.net) for
creating an open source (Free with a non propriatary license)
alternative Firmware for Mikrokopter (http://www.mikrokopter.de)
Brushless DC Motor Controllers. The goal is also to make a clean,
maintainable and easy to understand codebase for experimentation.

Goals:
======

* Clean well structured code.
* Find out what concepts can be implemented on the MK ESC
  * Adaptive timing
  * Active breaking (probably not possible)
  * Speed controller
  * Current controller

Status:
=======

As of 2009-02-16:

What works:
-----------
* Motor start routine works.
* Comparator based commutation detection based commutation works.

Known problems:
---------------

* Motor start routine is not 100% reliable.

* In low speeds the commutation detection based commutation skipps
  sometimes.
